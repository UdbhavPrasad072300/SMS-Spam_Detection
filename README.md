Jan 2020 â€“ Feb 2020

Hosted Link: https://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~uprasad/Projects/SMS_Spam-Detection.html

Python File: https://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~uprasad/Projects/SMS_Spam-Detection.py

Disclaimer:
1. A more elegant approach could have been used but it was expanded for explaining purposes
2. More data cleaning methods could have been used
3. Feature Engineering could have also been used (adding elements such as length of text messages or amount of punctuation)
4. Not tested using external data (Except, maybe K-fold cross-validation qualifies)
5. This project was more of a practice than performance; and most definitely contains errors, poor variable naming and what not.

Please let me know if you find errors!
